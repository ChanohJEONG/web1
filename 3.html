<h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/introduction/ECMA-and-javascript.php" target="_blank" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is <strong>a programming language commonly used in web development.</strong> It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.</p>

<p>Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a basic JavaScript function that adds two numbers. The function is called with the parameters 7 and 11. If the code below were included in the HTML of a webpage, it would display the text "18" in an alert box.</p>

<p>[script]
  function sum(a,b)
  {
    return a + b;
  }
  var total = sum(7,11);
  alert(total);
[script]</p>

<p>JavaScript functions can be called within [script] tags or when specific events take place. Examples include onClick, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onFocus, onBlur, onSubmit, and many others. While standard JavaScript is still used for performing basic client-side functions, many web developers now prefer to use JavaScript libraries like jQuery to add more advanced dynamic elements to websites.</p>
